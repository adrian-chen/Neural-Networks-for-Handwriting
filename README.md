# Training Deep Neural Networks
## Author: Adrian Chen

The code can be run using:
```
$ python train.py
```

In this program, I utilize several established tools:
Backpropagation
* Faster computation
* Compute gradient of the cost function

Cross-Entropy Cost Funtion
* 

```
10*abs(delta_x) + 10*abs(delta_y) + (14 - 20) * min(delta_x, delta_y)
```

Using a diagonal heuristic certainly has an advantage over a manhattan heuristic. The final path discovered is more optimal, however the number of squares expolored is also higher, meaning it is slower.
