# Training Deep Neural Networks
## Author: Adrian Chen

The code can be run using:
```
$ python train.py
```

In this program, I utilize several established tools:

Backpropagation
* Faster computation
* Compute gradient of the cost function

Cross-Entropy Cost Funtion
* Traditional cost function train slowly when the output is very different from the correct value
* Allows fast drastic error correction in the output.
